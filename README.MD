## Project Description:
This is a machine project for instance segmentation of mango leaf disease images for detection task using the YOLOv12 model. 
The image samples were sourced from the [MangoLeafBD Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/hxsnvwty3r/1), which consists of 
different images of mango leaves diagnosed with and without diseases. Annotation and augmentation was done in Roboflow to enhance 
the model's performance. The trained model achieved an outstanding **99.5% mAP50 and 98.9% mAP50-95 scores** on the validation set, with its best performance being on the 79th epoch, indicating how well it performed for the detection task.

This Streamlit website application is for the documentation and demonstration of the outcome of the machine project.
