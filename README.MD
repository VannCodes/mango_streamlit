## Project Description:
This is a machine project for instance segmentation of mango leaf disease images for detection task using the YOLOv12 model. The image samples were sourced from the [MangoLeafBD Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/hxsnvwty3r/1), which consists of different images of mango leaves diagnosed with and without diseases. Annotation and augmentation was done in Roboflow to enhance the model's performance. The trained model achieved a [insert mAP score], indicating how well it performed for the detection task.

This Streamlit website application is for demonstrating the outcome of the machine project.
